# wavetest-app

Internal **Technical Compliance Toolkit** for high-risk AI systems under the
EU AI Act. Streamlit GUI on top of the [waveImpact Responsible AI Toolchain](https://github.com/waveImpactGmbH/RAI-TOOLCHAIN),
replacing the notebook-based workflow with a browser UI for ≤10 analysts.

> **Analyst quickstart:** see [docs/AUDIT_MANUAL.md](docs/AUDIT_MANUAL.md) for
> the step-by-step workflow, per-module input requirements, example CSVs, and
> how to read the reports.

## Scope

The toolkit covers the **technical** half of an EU AI Act high-risk-system
audit. Each module produces a customer-deliverable report.

| Article | Topic | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Art. 9 | Risk management system | ✅ Covered (Risk Register module) |
| Art. 10 | Data and data governance | ✅ Covered (Data Quality module) |
| Art. 12 | Record-keeping | ✅ Covered (Logging Framework module) |
| Art. 13 | Transparency (model-level) | 🟡 Partial (Explainability — model logic only, not deployer info package) |
| Art. 14 | Human oversight | ✅ Covered (Human Oversight module) |
| Art. 15 | Accuracy & robustness | ✅ Covered (Performance Monitoring for accuracy/drift; Cybersecurity questionnaire for Art. 15(5) — active ART-based testing tracked as a follow-up) |
| Art. 61 / 72 | Post-market monitoring | 🟡 Partial (Monitoring + Logging — formal incident lifecycle missing) |
| Art. 73 | Serious-incident reporting | ✅ Covered (Incidents module) |
| Art. 86 | Individual right to explanation | ✅ Covered (Right-to-Explanation module) |
| Art. 11, 16-29, 47, 49 | Technical docs / QMS / DoC / CE | ❌ Not yet covered — see [HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md) |
| _voluntary_ | Sustainability (carbon footprint) | ✅ Covered (Sustainability v0 — useful for CSRD / ISO 42001) |

The app is **not** a substitute for full conformity assessment, a quality
management system, or notified-body interaction. It produces the technical
evidence and reports that feed into those processes.

```

The app **owns the persistence layer** (SQLite). The `wavetest_*` packages are imported as
libraries — the app instantiates each orchestrator with kwargs read from the DB and writes
artefacts to a per-project folder. Running an assessment never touches the toolchain repo.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- The `RAI-TOOLCHAIN` repo checked out somewhere on disk (default expectation:
  `~/Documents/GitHub/RAI-TOOLCHAIN`).

## Setup

```bash
cd ~/develop/wavetest-app

# 1. Create a venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install the app + deps
pip install -e .

# 3. Editable-install the six wavetest_* packages from your toolchain checkout
./scripts/install_toolchain.sh ~/Documents/GitHub/RAI-TOOLCHAIN

# 4. Initialise the SQLite database (creates data/wavetest_app.db with all tables)
alembic upgrade head

# 5. (Optional) Import your existing waveImpact_ClientManagement/*.json data
python scripts/import_console_json.py --toolchain ~/Documents/GitHub/RAI-TOOLCHAIN

# 6. Bootstrap the first user (auth/users.yaml is gitignored)
python scripts/auth_add_user.py

# 7. Run the app
streamlit run Home.py
```

Streamlit serves on `http://localhost:8501` by default. The Home page renders
a login form; every other page is gated by the same auth cookie.

## Running tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Schema migrations

Alembic is the source of truth for the schema. The `f9bff52d…_baseline_schema`
revision creates all four tables (`clients`, `systems`, `projects`,
`project_types`).

After altering `src/wavetest_app/db/models.py`:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe the change"
alembic upgrade head
```

For first-time setup, `alembic upgrade head` creates the schema and stamps the
DB at the latest revision. `python -m wavetest_app.db.session --init` is still
available as a quick `Base.metadata.create_all()` shortcut for throwaway dev
databases — but if you use it, run `alembic stamp head` afterwards so future
migrations apply cleanly.

If you have an existing pre-Alembic database, stamp it once:

```bash
alembic stamp head
```

## Building the analyst manual PDF

The Markdown manual at [docs/AUDIT_MANUAL.md](docs/AUDIT_MANUAL.md) is
the canonical source. Generate the branded PDF locally (we don't run
this in CI) with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_manual_pdf.py
# → docs/AUDIT_MANUAL.pdf
```

Skip the cover page or pick a different output path:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_manual_pdf.py --no-cover
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_manual_pdf.py --output /tmp/manual.pdf
```

Pure Python (markdown-pdf + PyMuPDF + pypdf + reportlab) — no Cairo /
Pango / wkhtmltopdf system dependencies. Re-run after editing the
Markdown.

## Authentication

`streamlit-authenticator` gates every page. Credentials live in `auth/users.yaml`
(gitignored — never commit) with bcrypt-hashed passwords and a JWT cookie key.

**Add a user:**

```bash
python scripts/auth_add_user.py                  # interactive
python scripts/auth_add_user.py \                # non-interactive
    --username jdoe --email jdoe@example.com \
    --name "John Doe" --password 's3cr3t' --role admin
```

The first run generates a random `cookie.key` and writes the file with mode
`0600`. Re-run to add more users; pass `--force` to overwrite an existing one.

Edits to `auth/users.yaml` are picked up on the next page render — no
Streamlit restart needed.

### Roles

Two roles, declared per-user in the `roles:` list of `auth/users.yaml`:

| Role | Can access |
| --- | --- |
| **analyst** | Home + the 6 assessment pages (Combined Report, Data Quality, Bias, Explainability, Logging, Performance Monitoring). |
| **admin** | Everything analysts can do, plus **Clients**, **Systems**, **Projects**, **Project Types**, and the **Audit Log** viewer. |

The bootstrap script defaults to `--role analyst`. **Create your first user
with `--role admin`** so you can set up clients and projects. To upgrade an
existing user later:

```bash
python scripts/auth_set_role.py --username YOU --role admin
# or multiple: --role analyst,admin
```

This touches _only_ the role list — no password re-entry needed.

The authenticated username is automatically captured in the `audit_log.actor`
column for every assessment run.

## Multi-analyst deployment (planned)

When deploying to a shared server:

1. Move SQLite DB to a persistent volume; configure backups via [Litestream](https://litestream.io)
2. Mount the `artifacts/` directory on a shared volume so all analysts see the same outputs
3. Optionally swap the in-app auth for an OIDC reverse proxy (Caddy / nginx + oauth2-proxy) if SSO is required

These are not in scope for the localhost-only scaffold but the architecture is designed for them.
